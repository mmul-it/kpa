# KPA manual commands

If you don't want to use the [KPA container](https://quay.io/repository/mmul/kpa) to automate everything, and you have different needs, than this page explain how to manual run every step of the *Knowledge Pods Approach*.

## Using the KPA container interactively

It is possible to launch the container interactively you will need to map the directory containing your project and the output directory.

This means that if you are on your project directory (in a project called `example`) you will use this command line:

```console
> docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  -v $PWD:/kpa/projects/example \
  -v /tmp:/kpa/output \
  quay.io/mmul/kpa
root@45a9a2efac84:/kpa# 
```

## Create the markdown files with `kpa_generator.yml`

The `kpa_generator` Ansible role is already available in the KPA container, but if you want to install it on your system you can use `ansible-galaxy`:

```bash
> ansible-galaxy install \
    -r playbooks/roles/requirements.yml \
    --roles-path ./playbooks/roles
Starting galaxy role install process
- downloading role 'kpa_generator', owned by mmul
- downloading role from https://github.com/mmul-it/kpa_generator/archive/main.tar.gz
- extracting mmul.kpa_generator to /home/rasca/Git/mmul-it/kpa/roles/mmul.kpa_generator
- mmul.kpa_generator (main) was installed successfully
```

Using the `ansible-playbook` command, the Ansible playbook named `kpa_generator.yml` under the `playbooks` folder, passing the **KPA Project** variables related to the common slides settings (`-e @projects/example/common/settings.yml`) and to the specific KPA document specification (`-e @projects/example/Example-Training-01.yml`) :

```bash
> ansible-playbook \
    -e @projects/example/common/settings.yml \
    -e @projects/example/Example-Training-01.yml \
    playbooks/kpa_generator.yml
```

The playbook tries to generate the pdf files for both slides and agenda if the two variables `pandoc_agenda_output_pdf` and `marp_output_pdf` are set, otherwise it will just generate the markdown files:

- The Marp slides: `Example-Training-01.md`, as declared in the `marp_output_file` variable.
- The schedule markdown: `Example-Training-01.schedule.md`, as declared in the `pandoc_agenda_output_file` variable.

For both variables check [projects/example/settings.yml](projects/example/settings.yml).

### About executing the `kpa_generator.yml` Ansible playbook

The `kpa_generator.yml` Ansible playbook lives inside the `playbooks` folder.

Since this will be its working directory it will need access to both `projects` and `output` folder and this is the reason you will find two symbolic links pointing to your KPA projects directory and slides output directory:

```bash
> ls -la playbooks/
total 16
drwxrwxr-x 3 rasca rasca 4096 gen 27 15:26 .
drwxrwxr-x 7 rasca rasca 4096 gen 27 17:28 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rasca rasca  139 gen 23 15:27 kpa_generator.yml
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rasca rasca   11 gen 27 15:26 projects -> ../projects
drwxrwxr-x 3 rasca rasca 4096 gen 27 16:02 roles
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rasca rasca    9 gen 27 15:26 output -> ../output
```

If you decide to store your projects in a different folder or you want a different output destination directory you can either change these symbolic links or use absolute paths for the `kpa_project_dir` and `marp_output_markdown`/`pandoc_agenda_output_markdown` Ansible variables.

## Create the presentation from the Marp Markdown file

To get a presentation, i.e. in html format, with the Markdown file generated by the `kpa_generator` Ansible role you can use the [Marp container](https://hub.docker.com/r/marpteam/marp-cli), like this:

```console
> docker run \
    --rm \
    -e LANG=$LANG \
    -e MARP_USER=$(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v $PWD:/home/marp/app/ \
    marpteam/marp-cli \
      --html true \
      --theme ./projects/example/common/theme.css \
      output/
[  INFO ] Converting 1 markdown...

```

Or if you are in the KPA container, like this:

```console
root@45a9a2efac84:/kpa# marp --html --theme projects/example/common/theme.css output/Example-Training-01.md  
[  INFO ] Converting 1 markdown...
[  INFO ] output/Example-Training-01.md => output/Example-Training-01.html
```

`Marp` supports exporting in `pdf`, `html` and `ppt`. You might want to remember the `--allow-local-files` when exporting into static files like `pdf` and `ppt`.

## Create the presentation agenda from the agenda markdown file

It is possible to use `pandoc` to convert the generated `Example-Training-01.agenda.md` file into a pdf:

```console
> pandoc --template=projects/example/common/example.tex \
    slides/Example-Training-01.schedule.md \
    -o slides/Example-Training-01.schedule.pdf
```

Check the [projects/example/common/example.tex](projects/example/common/example.tex) template that the `pandoc` is using is a simple one, but there's an infinite amount of possibilities with `pandoc` and texfiles.

### About exporting with `marp-cli`

When exporting, the destination directory of your file should contain the images, `.css` files and so on, since it will process them "live". For this reason, you will find a symbolic link pointing to your KPA projects directory inside the `slides` output directory:

```bash
> ls -la slides/
total 3196
drwxrwxr-x 2 rasca rasca    4096 gen 17 18:37 .
drwxrwxr-x 7 rasca rasca    4096 gen 17 18:30 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rasca rasca      10 gen 17 18:37 projects -> ../projects
-rw-r--r-- 1 rasca rasca  144942 gen 17 17:27 slides.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rasca rasca   11874 gen 17 17:27 slides.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 rasca rasca 3102777 gen 17 18:29 slides.pdf
```

If you want to change the destination of your `.html` slides, remember that you will need the projects directory (or a link) in there.

### Themes

For the Example training, a custom css (check [projects/example/theme.css](projects/example/theme.css)) has been created to give a sample on how the look & feel might be changed.

The theme can be integrated with the various tools available for Marp:

- [Marp for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode): In the `settings.json` file
  
  ```json
  {
    "markdown.marp.themes": ["./projects/example/theme.css"],
    "markdown.marp.enableHtml": true
  }
  ```

- With the [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli)
  
  ```bash
  > docker run \
    --rm \
    -e LANG=$LANG \
    -e MARP_USER=$(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v $PWD:/home/marp/app/ \
    marpteam/marp-cli \
      --html true \
      --theme ./projects/example/theme.css \
      --pdf \
      --allow-local-files \
      slides/slides.md
  [  INFO ] Converting 1 markdown...
  [  WARN ] Insecure local file accessing is enabled for conversion from
            slides/Example-Training-01.md.
  [  INFO ] slides/Example-Training-01.md => slides/Example-Training-01.pdf
  ```
