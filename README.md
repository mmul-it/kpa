# ![KPA - The Knowledge Pods Approach](./images/kpa-github-header.png)

[![GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/mmul-it/kpa/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/mmul-it/kpa/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository defines the **Knowledge Pods Approach** (**KPA**), an agile way
to create, maintain and evolve training materials and presentations using
standard [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files to create
beautiful slide sets and agendas.

## What is KPA

The **Knowledge Pods Approach (KPA)** is a method for creating training
materials, presentations and documentation that separates the content creation
(*the knowledge*) from their presentation (*the files*, i.e. pdf, ppt and html).

**KPA** relies on the standard markdown file format, which means that there will
be no need to rely on proprietary tools and formats to create contents.

**KPA** helps to concentrate on what matters most: the knowledge.

**KPA** is at the same time:

- The definition of an approach, described in this page.
- A container named **kpa** available on the main public container registries:
  - [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/mmul-it/kpa).
  - [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/mmul/kpa).
  - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmul/kpa).
- An Ansible role named **kpa_generator** available in
  [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/mmul/kpa_generator).

## What is a KPA project

A **KPA project** is a set of variables and markdown files that are used by the
Ansible role named [kpa_generator](https://github.com/mmul-it/kpa_generator) to
automate the creation of a single combined markdown file that can be processed
by [Marp (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem)](https://marp.app/#get-started) to
obtain a set of slides in the usual presentation formats like **html**, **pdf**
and **ppt**.
The **kpa_generator** Ansible role generates also an agenda markdown that is
converted to a PDF using the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) tool.

**KPA** makes it possible to control all the knowledge in a standard and "edit
from everywhere" way, making it easy to compose and mix the set of topics you
want to include into the training, by creating sequences of **Knowledge Pods**
(**KP**).

## What is a Knowledge Pod

A **Knowledge Pod** (**KP**) is the smallest part you can split a section of a
training or of a presentation.

You can imagine it as a chapter. For example, if you need to deliver a training
named "**How to use my technology**" in which you'll have to cover an
**introduction** to your technology, the **prerequisites**, the **installation**
and finally **day 0 operation**, then each one of these chapters would be a
Knowledge Pod, like:

- *Introduction.md*
- *Prerequisites.md*
- *Installation.md*
- *Day-0-operations.md*

A **Knowledge Pod** should have, uniformly, the same duration (say one hour), so
that it will be easy to compose a training by picking the needed KPs.

Each section of a **Knowledge Pod**, say a paragraph, is separated from the
other with the `---` Markdown element, which represents a new slide.

## What are the benefits of adopting KPA

There are several benefits using KPA:

- **Concentrate <u>just</u> on the contents**: once you have defined your
  project, you don't need to care about anything but writing Knowledge Pods.
  No need to manually syntax highlight your code blocks, no need to adapt text,
  no need to duplicate your slide to modify just a simple sentence.
  Just write your Knowledge Pods in Markdown and you're good to go.
- **Compose training and presentations <u>dynamically</u>**: no more Power Point
  slides cut and paste. You can combine your Knowledge Pods in the way that fits
  your needs, creating as many variants of your training and presentations as
  you need.
- **Have the same look & feel for <u>every</u> training or presentation**: no
  more "*Ok, now you need to apply this new slide format to all our 100
  presentations*". You will define your project look & feel one time and it will
  be applied everywhere, always the same way.
- **Use a <u>standard</u> and <u>reusable</u> format**: the same documentation
  you will produce with KPA could be used wherever you want because it's
  markdown, which is a standard, and you will be able to write your own tool to
  manage your **Knowledge Pods**.
- **Keep everything versioned and <u>in order</u>**: once you'll store your KPA
  projects in a Git repository, you'll get versioning, monitoring of the changes
  and your entire knowledge in one traceable place.
- **Let everyone <u>do their job</u>**: Markdown is simple to the point that
  even non-technical people can edit Knowledge Pods and this allows for everyone
  to do their job: graphics can work on the themes, instructors can write the
  contents and you, the **KPA master ©**, will put everything together.

## How to create a KPA project

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mmul-it/kpa.git

> cd kpa
```

You'll see a `projects` directory, which is meant to contain all your KPA
projects. You can use `example` project as your starting point.

This is the structure of a **KPA project**:

```console
projects/example/
├── common
│   ├── settings.yml
│   ├── example.tex
│   └── theme.css
├── images
│   ├── chapter-background.png
│   ├── cover-background.png
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── slide-background.png
├── templates
│   ├── chapter.md.j2
│   └── cover.md.j2
├── contents
│   ├── Topic-10.md
│   ├── ...
│   └── Topic-18.md
└── Example-Training-01.yml
```

Where:

- [common](projects/example/common): is the home for shared
  training/presentation files:
  - [theme.css](projects/example/common/theme.css) is the css theme file that
    overrides Marp's default theme. This is not needed, you can use a
    [predefined Marp theme](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/tree/main/themes).
  - [example.tex](projects/example/common/example.tex) is the Pandoc texfile
    template. This is not *strictly* needed, but to get the best from the
    generated agenda pdf a Pandoc template is more than reasonable.
  - [settings.yml](projects/example/common/settings.yml) **is mandatory** and
    contains the general presentation parameters that will override role's
    defaults:

    ```yaml
    ---

    # KPA

    # Marp
    marp_theme: example
    marp_theme_file: "{{ kpa_project_dir }}/common/theme.css"
    marp_background_color: #ffffff
    marp_background_image: "{{ kpa_project_dir }}/images/slide-background.png"
    marp_paginate: true
    marp_cover_template: "{{ kpa_project_dir }}/templates/cover.md.j2"

    marp_chapter_background_image: "{{ kpa_project_dir }}/images/chapter-background.png"
    ```

- [images](projects/example/images/) contains backgrounds, logos and all the
  useful graphics elements for the slides.
- [templates](projects/example/templates/) contains the templates for the
  special slides that will be processed by Ansible. These templates will parse
  the variables, to be reusable. For example, the [chapter.md.j2](projects/example/templates/chapter.md.j2)
  contains the layout for the slide that will be shown at the beginning of each
  KP/Chapter:

  ```markdown
  ---

  <!-- _backgroundImage: url({{ marp_chapter_background_image }}) -->

  # <span class="txt-yellow">{{ slide.title }}</span>

  <span class="txt-yellow">{{ slide.chapter }}</span>
  ```

  The variables used in this file can be declared globally (like
  `marp_chapter_backgroundImage`, see [slides-settings.yml](projects/example/slides-settings.yml))
   or specifically (like `slide.title`, see [Example-Training-01.yml](projects/example/Example-Training-01.yml)).
- [contents](projects/example/contents/) contains the **Knowledge Pods** in the
  [Marp Markdown compatible format](https://marpit.marp.app/markdown) (The main
  rule: `---` is the beginning of a new slide).
- [Example-Training-01.yml](projects/example/Example-Training-01.yml) is the
  slides set declaration, it contains the structure of the document, in a list
  element:

  ```yaml
  ---

  # KPA

  kpa_contents: "{{ kpa_project_dir }}/contents"
  kpa_slides:
    # DAY 1
    - cover: true

      ...
      ...
    - chapter: 'DAY THREE - PART EIGHTEEN'
      title: 'Topic 18'
      content: "{{ kpa_contents }}/Topic-18.md"

  # Output
  output_file: "slides/Example-Training-01"
  schedule_output_file: "{{ output_file }}.schedule.md"
  marp_output_file: "{{ output_file }}.md"
  ```

## How to use the KPA container

KPA comes with a handy container that can be used to automate the creation of
both the slides and the agenda PDF files.

Once you have a local project in place:

```console
> ls -1
common
contents
Example-Training-01.yml
images
templates
```

You will need to launch the container by:

- Mapping the project directory as a volume inside the
  `/kpa/projects/<project name>` container's directory.
- Mapping the output directory (in this example `/tmp`) inside the
  `/kpa/output` container's directory.
- Pass the `--project <project name>` (in this example `example`) and
  `--yml <kpa document yaml>` (in this example `Example-Training-01.yml`)
  options.

Your command line will be something like this:

```console
> docker run --rm \
  -v $PWD:/kpa/projects/example \
  -v /tmp:/kpa/output \
  ghcr.io/mmul/kpa --project example --yml Example-Training-01.yml
```

After a really short time you should get:

```console
Rendering example KPA project for Example-Training-01.yml file -> Completed.
```

The output files will be created in the output mapped directory (in this example
`/tmp`):

```console
> ls -1 /tmp/Example-Training-01.*
/tmp/Example-Training-01.agenda.md
/tmp/Example-Training-01.agenda.pdf
/tmp/Example-Training-01.md
/tmp/Example-Training-01.pdf
```

**Note**: in case of errors, it is possible to use the `-v|--verbose` option to
get a more talkative output (in fact the `ansbile-playbook` output).

### Results

The KPA container execution should produce these set of slides and agenda inside
the mapped output directory:

- Cover:

  ![images/slide-cover.png](images/slide-cover.png)

- Chapter:

  ![](images/slide-chapter.png)

- Slide:

  ![](images/slide.png)

- Agenda:

  ![](images/schedule.png)

### How to use KPA manually and in CI

The KPA container can be used interactively, and will give you an environment
with all the tools needed to generate both slides and agenda, but it is also
possible to use the `kpa_generator` Ansible role locally. Check the
[KPA manual commands](Commands.md) document to learn how to use the tools
manually.

If you are interested in a deeper way of integrating KPA you can check the
[Using KPA in CI](CI.md) document to understand how to use KPA in both GitHub
and GitLab CI workloads.
